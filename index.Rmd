I am an interdisciplinary biologist & data scientist, with a Ph.D. in Pharmacology and over a decade of experience in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, microscopy and image analysis. I currently live in the Kansas City metro area where I am a Scientist working in the [Systems Mass Spectrometry](https://www.stowers.org/technology/proteomics) group at the [Stowers Institute for Medical Research](https://www.stowers.org). I use and develop open science tools to analyze and integrate multi-omics datasets including single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, quantitative proteomics and imaging mass spectrometry. I’m passionate about open science, data visualization, scientific communication and building the scientific research community in the Kansas City region.
