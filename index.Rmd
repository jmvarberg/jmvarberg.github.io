I am a interdisciplinary cell biologist using the powers of yeast genetics and advanced microscopy techniques to study the structure and organization of the nucleus. Currently, I live in the Kansas City metro where I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research.
